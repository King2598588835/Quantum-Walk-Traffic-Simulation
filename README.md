## 🚀 Data processing procedure

Please run the scripts in the src/ directory in sequence to complete the entire analysis process:

### Step 1: src/轨迹预处理与简化.py

* ​**function**​：​**Standardization and Compression Cleaning of Multi-source Trajectory Data**​。
  
  * ​**Intelligent Parsing**​：Automatically recognize Roman data (in TXT/POINT format) and the mainstream CSV tracking format in China, with the unified fields being [id, time, lon, lat].
  * ​**Cleaning and noise reduction**​：Using the transbigdata toolkit, we removed the points with drifting latitude and longitude, abnormal speed values, and redundant duplicate records.
  * ​**Trajectory simplification**​：Integrating the **Douglas-Peucker (DP) algorithm**, it significantly reduces the data dimension while preserving the geometric features of the trajectory.
  * ​**Standardized output**​：Automatically filter out invalid trajectories that are shorter than 5 points, and consecutively renumber the IDs to prepare high-quality input for the subsequent quantum walk simulation.
* ​**import**​：The original TXT or CSV files located in the "data/Original Data/" directory.
* ​**output**​：The normalized \*\_cleaned.csv file located in the "data" directory after the original data has been processed.

### Step 2: src/总体数据统计.py

* ​**function**​：​**Advanced noise reduction, trajectory segmentation and temporal-spatial feature extraction**​。
  
  * ​**Automatic range locking **​：Based on the quantile algorithm, the geographical scope of the city is automatically identified and locked, and outliers such as those across cities or with abnormal coordinates (such as 0,0) are precisely eliminated.
  * ​**Dynamical denoising**​：Set a physical speed limit (150 km/h), and filter out non-logical trajectories such as teleportation and waypoints by using vectorized displacement calculations.
  * ​**Logical segmentation and smoothing**​：The trajectories of the data with long-term persistence are segmented, and the sliding window algorithm (Rolling Mean) is applied to smooth out the positioning errors and eliminate signal jitter.
  * ​**Duration and point count filtering**​：Automatically eliminate trajectories that are exceptionally long (exceeding 3 hours) or have too sparse recording points, to ensure the continuity of the modeling data.
* ​**import**​：data/原始数据处理后/ The cleaned CSV file under the directory。

### Step 3: src/总体统计绘制.py

* ​**function**​：​**Multidimensional Time-Space Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Diffusion Phase Transition**​。
  
  * **Basic Distribution Statistics **：Automatically extract and draw probability distribution graphs of the total displacement, total duration, single flight length (Flight Length), and instantaneous speed of the trajectory. Use the quantile algorithm to eliminate outliers, and visually present the basic characteristics of urban traffic flow.
  * ​**MSD omnidirectional displacement analysis**​：Calculate the mean squared displacement (Mean Squared Displacement) at different time steps (Δt), and reveal the spatial diffusion rate of the individual.
  * **Extraction of diffusion phase transition index**：Using the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the logarithmic curve and calculate the gradient, dynamically identify whether the trajectory is in the "sub-diffusion", "normal diffusion" or "super-diffusion" state.
  * ​**Strict truncation mechanism**​：It incorporates the "bottom rebound" and "zero-point truncation" logic, automatically identifying and discarding data intervals with invalid physical meanings, ensuring the scientific rigor of the diffusion feature analysis.
* ​**import**​：data/总体数据统计/ The cleaned CSV files under the directory.
* ​**output**​：在 data/总体数据统计/ The following creates a folder with the same name for each file, which contains:
  
  * \*\_基础分布统计.png：Macro-statistics Four-in-One Chart.

* ​**function**​：**Individual mobility measurement and multi-scale classification (analysis of turning radius Rg)**。
  
  * ​**Calculation of turning radius**​：Using the geodesic distance algorithm, the rotation radius Rg​ of each trajectory relative to its centroid is calculated, which serves as the core indicator for measuring the individual's spatial activity range.
  * ​**Adaptive clustering analysis**​：Integrate **K-means clustering** with **the Elbow Method**.Automatically determine the optimal number of classifications, and divide the massive trajectories into different energy levels based on their spatial expansion capabilities (such as: small scale, medium scale, and large scale).
  * ​**Logical reordering**​：By performing mean mapping on the clustering labels, it is ensured that the classification results have physical significance (for example: Label 1 always corresponds to the short-distance activity group with the smallest Rg value).
  * ​**Multi-level data splitting**​：Automatically generate sub-data sets after classification, providing sample support for subsequent studies on the quantum walk characteristics of different mobility groups.

  * ​**Dynamic time segmentation**​：Set the threshold at 30 minutes. Automatically identify and segment the long-stationary points in the trajectory, and split a single long trajectory into "sub-trajectory segments" with continuous movement characteristics, in order to meet the assumption of the stable process of quantum walking.
  * ​**Dynamics smoothing**​：Apply the sliding window smoothing algorithm to correct GPS positioning jitter and improve the geometric quality of the trajectory.
  * ​**Recursive structure preservation**​：Automatic traversal data/分类后数据/ Navigate through all the city subfolders and maintain the original classification directory structure, achieving fully automatic batch processing.

  * ​**Group MSD evolution**​：Within the subsets classified as small/middle/large scales, the ensemble mean displacement (Ensemble MSD) was calculated to reveal the spatial expansion patterns of different groups over time.
  * ​**Local diffusion index extraction**​：The logarithmic MSD curve was smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay filter, and the time dimension derivative α(t) was extracted to dynamically identify the physical properties of the traffic flow at different time stages (such as the transition from super-diffusion to sub-diffusion).
  * ​**Power-law Fit**：Perform linear regression in the double-logarithmic coordinate system, and automatically calculate the global proportion coefficient and the R2 goodness-of-fit.
  * ​**Statistical truncation protection**​：built-in REBOUND\_THRESHOLD Truncate the logic. When the data sample size becomes sparse due to the large time span, causing the α index to exhibit an abnormal rebound, automatic truncation will be carried out to ensure the scientific nature of the conclusion.

  * ​**Space density measurement**​：Count the frequency of trajectory points in each grid cell, and dynamically set the density threshold based on quantiles to automatically remove low-frequency background noise and identify the high-load areas of urban traffic.
  * ​**geographic information visualization**​：Integrate GeoPandas to draw a spatial distribution heat map, and present the occupancy characteristics of different scale groups (small/middle/large Rg) in the urban space through graded colors (Quantiles Scheme).

  * **Vectorization extraction of road network**：Using ArcGIS, the grid trajectory density generated by Step 7 was log-standardized. The basic road skeleton was extracted through "File to Points" and vectorization tools, and then connected and simplified reasonably to generate a road vector file in the `.shp` format.
  * **Automatic coordinate system projection**：The system automatically identifies the **UTM projection zone** to which it belongs based on the road network's center of mass (such as EPSG:32633), and converts the geographic latitude and longitude coordinates into metric units to ensure the accuracy of the physical length calculation (length_m).
  * **Topological fusion and cleaning**：Use the `unary_union` operator to perform topological merging on the extracted scattered line segments, fix the disconnected roads and overlapping line segments, and automatically call `make_valid` to correct geometric topological errors, ensuring the connectivity of the road network.
  * **Graph theory relationship mapping and subdivision**：Based on the area of the research region, the edge length threshold (300m - 5000m) is automatically adjusted to perform interpolation segmentation for long sections; at the same time, all intersections are automatically extracted as **nodes (Nodes)** and a topology mapping table of **edges (Edges)** is established to build a complete mathematical graph model.

  * ​**Intelligent Start Search (Smart Scout)​**​：By combining the degree centrality, geometric center, and grid sampling techniques, the system automatically identifies the initial node of the quantum walk that best represents the origin of urban transportation.
  * ​**Multistage Forward Regression (Multi-stage Fitting)​**​：
    * ​**The rough scanning stage**​：Search for the initial range of the coupling constant γ within a wide range.
    * ​**The precise fitting stage**​：By using double-layer gradient iteration, the physical parameters that precisely minimize the loss function between the simulated MSD and the real MSD are accurately determined.
  * ​**Physical consistency verification**​：Simultaneously fit the mean square displacement (MSD) and the diffusion index α(t)
    ，Ensure that the simulation process is not only aligned in terms of the rate of spatial expansion, but also physically consistent with the real traffic flow in terms of the diffusion phase transition behavior.
